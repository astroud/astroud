### Hi there 👋 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects for my portfolio and finding my next job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via a variety of tools: Wes Bos' [excellent series of JavaScript courses](https://wesbos.com/courses), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Exercism](http://exercism.io), [Codewars](http://codewars.com), and more.
- 🍻 I’m looking to collaborate on projects coded in JavaScript and the Front-end.
- 🤔 I’m looking to meet new people. I took a sabbatical of sorts traveling with the family via 🚐 and building 🏗 a business with my wife.
- 💬 Ask me about why there are [no solutions, only tradeoffs](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2007/Robertsopportunitycost.html).
- 📫 How to reach me: [@aaron_stroud](http://twitter.com/aaron_stroud) or using my first name @ first + last.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been to [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall).
