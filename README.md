####  🌱 &nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite learning resources: building [Frontend Mentor](http://frontendmentor.io) Figma designs with React, the [Full Stack Open course](http://fullstackopen.com), [CodeBookClub](https://madisonkanna.com/codebookclub/), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Exercism](http://exercism.io), [Codewars](http://codewars.com), Wes Bos' [excellent series of JavaScript courses](https://wesbos.com/courses), and more.
####  🤔 &nbsp;&nbsp;I like meeting new people. So much so that I took a sabbatical of sorts traveling the country with the family via RV 🚐.
